Algorithm 1:
Upload all images and first place it on corners then come to the middle.

If space left :
	Extend all images up to a point until no overlap and fill the background with some color.

If photos overlap.
	REsize images keeping aspect ratios same until no overlap
	
	
Algorithm 2(Used in colw.py):
I used 7 default templates to arrange photos in the canvas. More and
more templates can be added without changing much code. These
templates will be merged with each other in the final canvas of the image
making a collage. All the photos can be taken as random input which will
result in random canvas containing different photos each time it is
refreshed. This will give user more than one options for the collage.Also
while loops can be arranged in random order or called randomly by putting 
those loops in separate functions.
